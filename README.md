# Ohmmeter

An analog serial Arduino based ohmmeter developed in LabVIEW 2020

## Getting Started

### Install LabVIEW

First of all you must have LabVIEW installed in your machine, you can download its community version in the NI LabVIEW Community Edition [webpage](https://www.ni.com/pt-br/shop/labview/select-edition/labview-community-edition.html) for free. :star_struck:

### Prepare your Arduino

Well, as expected you must install a little NI program in your arduino to build the bridge between Arduinos C++ and the LabVIEW languages. 	:disappointed_relieved:
It's a quick process and well ilustrated in this nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGRhIQneO6w). :sunglasses:


### Git Clone the Project

Ok! Now that we already did all of that it's time to clone the Ohmmeter project.  Choose a directory, open it in your gitbash and run the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/vitorpp0/Ohmmeter.git
```

After the cloning process open the Ohmmeter.lvproj and then the Ohmmeter.VI as illustrated below.
